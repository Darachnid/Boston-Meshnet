# **Boston Meshnet**

Welcome to the Boston Meshtastic Project, an initiative leveraging the Meshtastic mesh network to boost community connectivity and support local initiatives with technology. We focus on utilizing low-cost, long-range Meshtastic devices throughout Boston to enable seamless communication and encourage a culture of innovation and collaboration.

## **What is [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/)?**

Meshtastic is akin to passing a note in class through friends to reach someone across the room but with electronic messages. Using small gadgets that communicate with each other, messages can hop from one device to another until they reach the intended recipient. This method allows for message and location sharing over vast distances, ensuring connectivity without reliance on traditional phone services.

## **Community Engagement and Support**

We're dedicated to empowering community members to lead initiatives using technology to advocate for social justice and provide community support. Our project encourages direct participation — see the issues page to join or lead initiatives without needing permission.

## **Collaboration and Contribution**

 **Open Source Model**: We operate on an open-source model to foster transparency, collaboration, and communal growth, providing tools and resources for any community to adapt and customize the project.

 **Community-Driven Development**: By valuing community input and feedback, we ensure our technology meets the specific needs of Boston’s diverse neighborhoods.
